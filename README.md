# A Meal From Home official website

A-Meal-From-Home is a university student club filming documentories of the local food to record the recipes and the stories behind.

We are a tean who visited around dozens of local families from the north to the south of Taiwan, learned how to make 

the precious local food related with the nature and the human geography , and finally collected all of the recipes and stories as words 

and videoes to leave them for the next generation.
